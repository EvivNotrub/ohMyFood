Projet Open Classrooms cursus intégrateur Web 2023: Améliorez l'interface d'un site mobile avec des animations CSS
This project is meant to learn building some simple animations in a website during the OpenClassroom program on web integration.
It is based on their design with a list of animations that should appear on the site when interacting.

LOADER:
With the loader and "background-clip: text",  letters got cut off due to the bounding box and probably to connective script fonts properties. A way to bypass it is to add padding and négative margin.
